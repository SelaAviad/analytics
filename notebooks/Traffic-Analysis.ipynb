We'll use SQL Query to search for traffic accidents occurring between 5pm and 8pm and have victims whose ages are between 20 and 35. We've taken care of uploading the data set to IBM Cloud Object Storage (COS) for you so you don't need to download and then upload the data set to your COS bucket.\n\nTo use this notebook, you'll need (in this order):\n\n- IBM Cloud Object Storage - lite plan\n- IBM Cloud SQL Query\n\nOnce you've provisioned the SQL Query service, click the **Open UI** button. This will generate a COS bucket for you that will store the results of your SQL queries. We'll need this bucket in order tell SQL Query where to store and retrieve the result sets. \n\nTo get started, run the next cell to download the latest versions of ibmcloudsql and PixieDust.",

But, you can use any bucket in COS to store your results. To get that COS bucket URL, go to COS then look for the generated bucket. Then click the kabob menu button at the end of that bucket name. You'll have the option to view the **Bucket SQL URL**. Once that's clicked, you will see a pop-up window with the URL. Add that to the variable `sql_cos_endpoint`.\n\nWe've added the suffix `/accidents` at the end of this URL.
